"Semi-automatic generation of screenshots for the gtkmm tutorial"

-- make_screenshots.pl is a Perl script which is a first attempt at an automatic
screenshot generator. It's not fully automatic, though. It generates
screenshots by starting an example program and saving a screenshot of the
program's window as it looks just after start-up.

63 screenshots are shown in the tutorial. 47 of them will be correctly
generated in this simple way. The other 16 screenshots require some kind of
user input or a specific location of the cursor before they are saved.

Most example programs must be built before make_screenshots.pl is executed.
'make check' does that.

The screenshots are saved by gnome-screenshot.
The gnome-screenshot bugs https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129768 and
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=594141 must have been implemented
(added in the git repository 2012-05-23 and 2012-05-24).

-- make_screenshots.sh is a shell script that calls make_screenshots.pl with
appropriate parameters.

-- progs-and-figs.txt is input data to make_screenshots.pl.

At present make_screenshots.sh is not called from any Makefile.
