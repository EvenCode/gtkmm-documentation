2007-11-07  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: added a bit more information to the
	'wrapping' appendix.  Added basic info about _MEMBER_GET/SET macros.  Also
	added a bit of clarification to the _WRAP_CTOR description, and added a
	brief section on 'basic' types

2007-11-05  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: add 'id' attributes for all of the elements
	that the docbook xsl stylesheets spit out warnings for.  This makes sure
	that the sub-page links will be more permanent as well, (e.g.
	gtkmm.org/docs/tutorial/page.html#permanent-id).  It's an annoyingly manual
	process, but I don't see any other alternative, and I think the benefits are
	worthwhile

2007-11-05  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: increase docbook version to 4.5 since I was
	using some markup that wasn't valid in the old 4.1.2 sepecification

2007-11-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: x-event-signals section:
	Mention add_events(), set_events(), and EventBox.
	EventBox section: Mention set_events().
	Bug #454709 (Daniel Hornung).

2007-11-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: Added a warning about not making TreeColumnRecords 
	static. Bug #443586 (Robert Pearce).

2007-11-03  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: fixed a couple more cvs-isms and changed them
	to reference svn instead

2007-11-03  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: added a bit more semantic markup to some
	classnames that I noticed was missing so they're displayed consistently in
	monospace font

2007-11-03  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/style.css: fixed the section mini-toc style change to also
	apply to appendixes, not just chapters

2007-11-03  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: update the 'working with cvs' section to
	refer to svn instead of cvs

2007-11-03  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/style.css: more minor style tweaking.  Only applied the
	slightly larger line-height to text in <p> elements so that other things
	like lists and stuff don't get too wide.  Also reduced the spacing between
	the mini-table-of-contents at the top of each chapter.

2007-11-02  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* update ignored files

2007-11-02  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/Makefile.am: build the tutorial using the section ids as the
	filenames.  This is much better for publishing on the web because under the
	old system, the filenames were based on the chapter/section numbers, so if
	you moved or inserted sections in the book, the urls would all be
	invalidated.  Now the urls will be valid as long as we don't change the IDs
	of the chapters and sections
	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: added 'id' attributes to all of the chapter
	and sect1 elements so that they can be used for filenames.  Also modified
	the id attributes to make them all follow the same general standard.

2007-11-01  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/style.css: minor style changes to the tutorial.  Remove bold
	font from filenames and function / variable names so that they don't stand
	out so much -- just make them monospaced.
	Also increase the default line height slightly to make it a bit easier to
	read, but don't increase the line height for the example code segments

2007-11-01  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: touched up the 'wrapping C libraries with
	gmmproc' chapter to use a lot more semantic markup, etc.

2007-10-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/: Moved non-book examples into an other/ 
	directory, so that these less-great examples don't 
	distract from all the good stuff in book/.

2007-10-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/Makefile.am: Build and upload the pdf when 
	uploading.

2007-10-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in: Corrected the package name.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in:
	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml:
	* examples/book/libglademm/derived/
	* examples/book/libglademm/simple/: Added the examples from 
	libglademm and included them inline in the gtkmm book in 
	the libglademm chapter.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed mentions of non-existing directories, 
	to fix the distcheck.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* scripts/Makefile.am:
	* scripts/docgen.m4:
	* scripts/reduced.m4: Removed unused .m4 files.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Initial version, moving examples/ and docs/ from the main 
	gtkmm module, so that the book can have examples of extra APIs.
