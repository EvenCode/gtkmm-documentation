	* docs/tutorial/style.css: minor style changes to the tutorial.  Remove bold
	font from filenames and function / variable names so that they don't stand
	out so much -- just make them monospaced.
	Also increase the default line height slightly to make it a bit easier to
	read, but don't increase the line height for the example code segments

2007-11-01  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@gnome.org>

	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml: touched up the 'wrapping C libraries with
	gmmproc' chapter to use a lot more semantic markup, etc.

	* configure.in:
	* examples/Makefile.am:
	* examples/: Moved non-book examples into an other/ 
	directory, so that these less-great examples don't 
	distract from all the good stuff in book/.

2007-10-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/tutorial/Makefile.am: Build and upload the pdf when 
	uploading.

	* configure.in: Corrected the package name.

	* configure.in:
	* docs/tutorial/gtkmm-tut.xml:
	* examples/book/libglademm/derived/
	* examples/book/libglademm/simple/: Added the examples from 
	libglademm and included them inline in the gtkmm book in 
	the libglademm chapter.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed mentions of non-existing directories, 
	to fix the distcheck.

2007-10-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* scripts/Makefile.am:
	* scripts/docgen.m4:
	* scripts/reduced.m4: Removed unused .m4 files.

	Initial version, moving examples/ and docs/ from the main 
	gtkmm module, so that the book can have examples of extra APIs.
