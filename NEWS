	Buttons chapter: Remove text about non-existant XPMLabelBox class.

	* docs/tutorial/C/gtkmm-tutorial-in.xml: The mention of an XPMLabelBox
	was very odd and probably about a very very old version of the API.

2010-07-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Fix the build with latest gtkmm-2.22 with --enable-warnings=fatal.

	Generally include gtkmm/box.h before other gtkmm headers and include
	gtkmm/main.h after other gtkmm headers. Not pleasant.

2010-06-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	Remove orphaned undef.

	Improve the Assistant example

	* examples/book/assistant/*: Move examplewindow.[cc|h] to
