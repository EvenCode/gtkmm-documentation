2.13.0:

Initial release.
This book and examples were previously in the gtkmm module itself.
They are now in their own gtkmm-documentation module so that that book may 
contain examples of other libraries such as libgdamm.

Recent Changes:
* Added full example in the libglademm section.
* Several new giomm examples in examples/book/giomm, not yet mentioned in the 
  book.
  (Jonathon Jongsma, Murray Cumming)
* examples/book/custom/custom_widget:
  make the class name in the .gtkrc file begin with a lower-case 'gtkmm__' 
  so that the rc file is parsed properly. 
  Jonathon Jongsma (Bug #396198) 
* Additions to the gmmproc chapter, about conversions, _CLASS_INTERFACE(),
  _WRAP_GERROR(), and _MEMBER_GET/SET().
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added a warning about not making TreeColumnRecords static. 
  (Murray Cumming) Bug #443586 (Robert Pearce).
