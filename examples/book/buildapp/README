=== gtkmm-documentation/examples/book/buildapp/step[1-9] ===

== Building the examples ==

The examples in this directory are built with 'make check' alongside the rest of
the examples in gtkmm-documentation.

The examples in the step[1-9] directories can also be built independently,
by doing:

  $ cd step1  # or step2, step3, etc.
  $ make -f Makefile.example

To make gnome-shell use the desktop file and icon for one of the examples
while running it uninstalled, do the following:

  $ cd step1  # or step2, step3, etc.
  $ make -f Makefile.example install-desktop-file
